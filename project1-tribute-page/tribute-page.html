					...was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer and bandleader. A progenitor of funk music and a
					major figure of 20th century popular music and dance, he is often referred to as the "Godfather of Soul".[2] In a career
					that lasted 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres.[3] Brown began his career as a gospel singer
					in Toccoa, Georgia. He joined an R&B vocal group, the Gospel Starlighters (which later evolved into the Flames), in
					which he was the lead singer.[4][5] First coming to national public attention in the late 1950s as a member of the singing
					group The Famous Flames with the hit ballads "Please, Please, Please" and "Try Me", Brown built a reputation as a tireless
					live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown
					Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as "Papa's Got
					a Brand New Bag", "I Got You (I Feel Good)" and "It's a Man's Man's Man's World". During the late 1960s he moved from
					a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly "Africanized" approach to music-making that influenced
					the development of funk music.[6] By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation
					of the J.B.s with records such as "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" and "The Payback". He also became noted
					for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit "Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud". Brown continued to perform
					and record until his death from congestive heart failure in 2006.
